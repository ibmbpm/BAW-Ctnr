The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

- Apache Tuscany(SDO) Modified Classes
IBM made certain modifications to the Apache Tuscany Code for the SDO component, which modifications are referred to as the `Apache Tuscany Classes (SDO)`. The Apache Tuscany Classes (SDO) were not contributed back to the Apache Software Foundation because they are unique to this Program and its SDO component. The list of modified Apache Tuscany Classes and source code for the Apache Tuscany Classes can be obtained from IBM by visiting http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wps/support and selecting `Technotes`. Under `Product category`, select `WPS Business Object Framework` as the search filter to locate technotes that provide information about this modified source code.

The following will be added to the notices file for Shrinksafe (and called out in the DOU for Dojo):

The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional Shrinksafe build tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed 
with that tool.  Shrinksafe contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License Version 1.1.  The 
source code for these modifications has been made available at the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.

The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or higher in order to run.  We are relying on the separate DD Checklist 
already approved for the Rhino 1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe package by default 
is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.

The following will be added to the notices file for Shrinksafe (and called out 
in the DOU for Dojo):

The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional Shrinksafe build 
tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed with that tool.  Shrinksafe 
contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License 
Version 1.1.  The source code for these modifications has been made available at 
the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.  

The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or higher in order to 
run.  We are relying on the separate DD Checklist already approved for the Rhino 
1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe 
package by default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.

3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Availability of Source Code.

  Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
  in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
  and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
  of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
  copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
  or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
  Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
  Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
  through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

  3.2. Modifications.

  The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
  governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
  believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
  have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

  3.3. Required Notices.

  You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
  identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
  remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
  within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
  descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
  Initial Developer.

  3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
  Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
  this License or the recipients` rights hereunder. You may choose to
  offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
  absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
  result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

  You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
  the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
  choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
  provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
  and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
  limit or alter the recipient`s rights in the Source Code form from
  the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
  Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
  it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
  are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
  Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
  Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

  3.6. Larger Works.

  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
  other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
  the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
  sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
  Software.

4. Versions of the License.

  4.1. New Versions.

  Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
  new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
  given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
  4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
  this License.

  4.2. Effect of New Versions.

  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
  Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
  the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
  prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
  under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
  make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered
  Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
  otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
  subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

  4.3. Modified Versions.

  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
  license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
  modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
  remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
  note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
  make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
  License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN `AS IS` BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
  IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
  NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
  THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
  ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
  AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
  Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
  termination of this License shall survive.

  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
  declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
  assert such claim is referred to as `Participant`) alleging that the
  Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
  Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
  Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
  indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
  Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
  Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
  from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
  expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
  day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
  Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
  a written agreement with Participant.

  6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
  alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
  license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
  infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
  into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
  license.

  6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
  all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
  distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
  granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
  INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
  COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
  TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
  LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
  APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
  PARTY`S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
  AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

  The Covered Software is a `commercial item,` as that term is defined
  in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of `commercial computer
  software` (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and `commercial computer software documentation`
  as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
  with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
  (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
  clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
  clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
  software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
  the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
  the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
  provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction`s conflict-of-law
  provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
  to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
  venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
  with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys` fees and expenses.
  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
  the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
  construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
  agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
  States export administration regulations (and the export control
  laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
  or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
  responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
  out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
  work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
  responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (`Public License`). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
Section 1 – Definitions.
Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter`s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.
License grant. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: 
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients. 
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 – License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
Attribution.
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: 
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License; 
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter`s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. 
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.
This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

GNU Lesser General Public License
Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author`s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
We call this license the `Lesser` General Public License because it does Less to protect the user`s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users` freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a `work based on the library` and a `work that uses the library`. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called `this License`). Each licensee is addressed as `you`.
A `library` means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The `Library`, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A `work based on the Library` means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term `modification`.)
`Source code` for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library`s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a `work that uses the Library`. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a `work that uses the Library` with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a `work that uses the library`. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a `work that uses the Library` uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a `work that uses the Library` with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer`s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable `work that uses the Library`, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user`s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the `work that uses the Library` must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients` exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and `any later version`, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY `AS IS` WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the `copyright` line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the library`s name and an idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a `copyright disclaimer` for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob` (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007 

----------------------------------------------------------- 



PREAMBLE 

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide 

development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation 

efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and 

open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership 

with others. 



The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and 

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The 

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 

redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved 

names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, 

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The 

requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply 

to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives. 



DEFINITIONS 

`Font Software` refers to the set of files released by the Copyright 

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may 

include source files, build scripts and documentation. 



`Reserved Font Name` refers to any names specified as such after the 

copyright statement(s). 



`Original Version` refers to the collection of Font Software components as 

distributed by the Copyright Holder(s). 



`Modified Version` refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, 

or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the 

Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a 

new environment. 



`Author` refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical 

writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software. 



PERMISSION & CONDITIONS 

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining 

a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, 

redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font 

Software, subject to the following conditions: 



1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, 

in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself. 



2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, 

redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy 

contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be 

included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or 

in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or 

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user. 



3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font 

Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding 

Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as 

presented to the users. 



4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font 

Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any 

Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the 

Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written 

permission. 



5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, 

must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be 

distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to 

remain under this license does not apply to any document created 

using the Font Software. 



TERMINATION 

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are 

not met. 



DISCLAIMER 

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED `AS IS`, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 

EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF 

MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT

      `Object` form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      `Work` shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      `Derivative Works` shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      `Contribution` shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a `NOTICE` text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an `AS IS` BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

This formulation of W3C`s notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of `use`. Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation`s assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI`s certification under the Open Source Definition.

          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).

          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version; 3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients` rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party`s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled `LEGAL` which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor`s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

          (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor`s Modifications are Contributor`s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients` rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients` rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient`s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation (`Netscape`) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases `Mozilla`, `MOZILLAPL`, `MOZPL`, `Netscape`, `MPL`, `NPL` or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN `AS IS` BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as `Participant`)  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant`s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant`s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant`s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY`S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a `commercial item,` as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of `commercial computer software` and `commercial computer software documentation,` as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys` fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as `Multiple-Licensed`.  `Multiple-Licensed` means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This formulation of W3C`s notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of `use`.
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation`s assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI`s certification under the Open Source Definition.

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party`s intellectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing the title `LEGAL` a description of each such claim and a description of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient`s use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version; 3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients` rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party`s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled `LEGAL` which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor`s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

          (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor`s Modifications are Contributor`s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients` rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients` rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient`s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation (`Netscape`) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases `Mozilla`, `MOZILLAPL`, `MOZPL`, `Netscape`, `MPL`, `NPL` or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN `AS IS` BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as `Participant`)  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant`s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant`s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant`s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY`S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a `commercial item,` as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of `commercial computer software` and `commercial computer software documentation,` as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys` fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as `Multiple-Licensed`.  `Multiple-Licensed` means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e. the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied, called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.


ANNOTATIONS
===========

  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.

  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as, but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to use and distribute a UPX compressed program.

  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -  any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious by definition.

  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.

  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.

1. NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit License Agreement
----------------------------------------


Important Notice
----------------

READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement (`Agreement`)
for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, including computer software and
associated documentation (`Software`), is the Agreement which
governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its
subsidiaries (`NVIDIA`) downloadable herefrom. By downloading,
installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, You (as
defined below) agree to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement,
do not download the SOFTWARE.


Recitals
--------

Use of NVIDIA`s SOFTWARE requires three elements: the
SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor (`NVIDIA
Hardware`), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected
by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as
well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The
SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your
use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA
Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but
this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such
hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package
with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and
conditions of the SOFTWARE only.


1.1. Definitions


1.1.1. Licensee

`You`, or `Your` shall mean the entity or individual that
downloads and uses the SOFTWARE.


1.1.2. Redistributable Software

`Redistributable Software` shall mean the redistributable
libraries referenced in Attachment A of this Agreement.


1.1.3. Software

`SOFTWARE` shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to
this Agreement.


1.2. Grant of License


1.2.1. Rights and Limitations of Grant

Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this
Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
(except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable
Software in Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3 of this
Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE, with the following
limitations:


1.2.1.1. Redistribution Rights

Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain
files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in
Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a)
the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in
binary form to Licensee`s licensees (`Customers`) only as a
component of Licensee`s own software products (each, a
`Licensee Application`); (b) Licensee shall design the
Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE
files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory
location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c)
Licensee shall obtain each Customer`s written or clickwrap
agreement to the license terms under a written, legally
enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the
SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less
restrictive than this Agreement.


1.2.1.2. Usage Rights

Licensee may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE
on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for
Licensee`s use within Licensee`s Enterprise. `Enterprise`
shall mean individual use by Licensee or any legal entity
(such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it
owns by more than 50 percent.


1.2.1.3. Further Redistribution Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee
may authorize Customers to further redistribute the
Redistributable SOFTWARE that such Customers receive as part
of the Licensee Application, solely in binary form, provided,
however, that Licensee shall require in their standard
software license agreements with Customers that all such
redistributions must be made pursuant to a license agreement
that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights
of NVIDIA whose terms and conditions are at least as
restrictive as those in the applicable Licensee software
license agreement covering the Licensee Application. For
avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall not
affect rights previously granted by Licensee to its Customers
under this Agreement to the extent validly granted to
Customers under Section 1.2.1.1.


1.2.1.4. Linux/FreeBSD Exception

Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 1.2.1.2,
Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3, SOFTWARE designed
exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems,
or other operating systems derived from the source code to
these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed,
provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any
way (except for unzipping of compressed files).


1.2.1.5. Additional Licensing Obligations

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that its use of certain third
party components included with the SOFTWARE may be subject to
additional licensing terms and conditions as set forth or
referenced in Attachment B of this Agreement.


1.2.1.6. Limitations

No Reverse Engineering

Licensee may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble
the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the
source code.

No Separation of Components

The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Except as
authorized in this Agreement, Software component parts of the
Software may not be separated for use on more than one
computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.

No Rental

Licensee may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.


1.3. Term and Termination

This Agreement will continue in effect for two (2) years
(`Initial Term`) after Your initial download and use of the
SOFTWARE, subject to the exclusive right of NVIDIA to
terminate as provided herein. The term of this Agreement will
automatically renew for successive one (1) year renewal terms
after the Initial Term, unless either party provides to the
other party at least three (3) months prior written notice of
termination before the end of the applicable renewal term.

This Agreement will automatically terminate if Licensee fails
to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such
event, Licensee must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and
all of its component parts.


Defensive Suspension

If Licensee commences or participates in any legal proceeding
against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,
suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights
provided under this Agreement during the pendency of such
legal proceedings.


1.4. Copyright

All rights, title, interest and copyrights in and to the
SOFTWARE (including but not limited to all images,
photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other
information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying
printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned
by NVIDIA, or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE is protected by
copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
Accordingly, Licensee is required to treat the SOFTWARE like
any other copyrighted material, except as otherwise allowed
pursuant to this Agreement and that it may make one copy of
the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive purposes.

RESTRICTED RIGHTS NOTICE. Software has been developed entirely
at private expense and is commercial computer software
provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Use, duplication or
disclosure by the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government
subcontractor is subject to the restrictions set forth in the
Agreement under which Software was obtained pursuant to DFARS
227.7202-3(a) or as set forth in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2)
of the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights clause
at FAR 52.227-19, as applicable. Contractor/manufacturer is
NVIDIA, 2701 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95050.


1.5. Applicable Law

This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall
be construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of Delaware.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed. The
courts of Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive
jurisdiction and venue over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement.


1.6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations on Liability


1.6.1. No Warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED `AS IS` AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.


1.6.2. No Liability for Consequential Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL NVIDIA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


1.6.3. No Support

NVIDIA has no obligation to support or to provide any updates
of the Software.


1.7. Miscellaneous

between the parties, the parties agree that in the event
Licensee or NVIDIA provides Feedback (as defined below) to the
other party on how to design, implement, or improve the
SOFTWARE or Licensee`s product(s) for use with the SOFTWARE,
the following terms and conditions apply the Feedback:


1.7.1.1. Exchange of Feedback

Both parties agree that neither party has an obligation to
give the other party any suggestions, comments or other
feedback, whether verbally or in written or source code form,
relating to (i) the SOFTWARE; (ii) Licensee`s products; (iii)
Licensee`s use of the SOFTWARE; or (iv)
optimization/interoperability of Licensee`s product with the
SOFTWARE (collectively defined as `Feedback`). In the event
either party provides Feedback to the other party, the party
receiving the Feedback may use any Feedback that the other
party voluntarily provides to improve the (i) SOFTWARE or
other related NVIDIA technologies, respectively for the
benefit of NVIDIA; or (ii) Licensee`s product or other related
Licensee technologies, respectively for the benefit of
Licensee. Accordingly, if either party provides Feedback to
the other party, both parties agree that the other party and
its respective licensees may freely use, reproduce, license,
distribute, and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in the
(i) SOFTWARE or other related technologies; or (ii) Licensee`s
products or other related technologies, respectively, without
the payment of any royalties or fees.


1.7.1.2. Residual Rights

Licensee agrees that NVIDIA shall be free to use any general
knowledge, skills and experience, (including, but not limited
to, ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques) (`Residuals`),
contained in the (i) Feedback provided by Licensee to NVIDIA;
(ii) Licensee`s products shared or disclosed to NVIDIA in
connection with the Feedback; or (c) Licensee`s confidential
information voluntarily provided to NVIDIA in connection with
the Feedback, which are retained in the memories of NVIDIA`s
employees, agents, or contractors who have had access to such
Residuals. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, NVIDIA`s employees, agents, or contractors shall
not be prevented from using Residuals as part of such
employee`s, agent`s or contractor`s general knowledge, skills,
experience, talent, and/or expertise. NVIDIA shall not have
any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such
employees, agents or contractors or to pay royalties for any
work resulting from the use of Residuals.


1.7.1.3. Disclaimer of Warranty

FEEDBACK FROM EITHER PARTY IS PROVIDED FOR THE OTHER PARTY`S
USE `AS IS` AND BOTH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. BOTH PARTIES DO NOT
REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE FEEDBACK WILL MEET THE OTHER
PARTY`S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OR IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE FEEDBACK WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.


1.7.1.4. No Liability for Consequential Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE FEEDBACK, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


1.7.2. Freedom of Action

Licensee agrees that this Agreement is nonexclusive and NVIDIA
may currently or in the future be developing software, other
technology or confidential information internally, or
receiving confidential information from other parties that
maybe similar to the Feedback and Licensee`s confidential
information (as provided in Section 1.7.1.2 above), which may
be provided to NVIDIA in connection with Feedback by Licensee.
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that nothing in this Agreement
will be construed as a representation or inference that NVIDIA
will not develop, design, manufacture, acquire, market
products, or have products developed, designed, manufactured,
acquired, or marketed for NVIDIA, that compete with the
Licensee`s products or confidential information.


1.7.3. No Implied Licenses

Under no circumstances should anything in this Agreement be
construed as NVIDIA granting by implication, estoppel or
otherwise, (i) a license to any NVIDIA product or technology
other than the SOFTWARE; or (ii) any additional license rights
for the SOFTWARE other than the licenses expressly granted in
this Agreement.


1.7.4. 

If any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, or
cannot be fully enforced under, the law, such provision will
be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be
consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This
Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement
between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and
agreements relating to such subject matter, whether oral or
written. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed
by an authorized officer of NVIDIA. Licensee agrees that it
will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
United States Bureau of Industry and Security or any export
laws, restrictions or regulations.


1.7.5. 

The parties agree that the following sections of the Agreement
will survive the termination of the License: Section 1.2.1.4,
Section 1.4, Section 1.5, Section 1.6, and Section 1.7.


1.8. Attachment A

    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the `BSD` licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the `doc` 
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also 
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are 
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

2. NVIDIA Corporation CUDA Samples End User License Agreement
-------------------------------------------------------------

BY DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE AND OTHER AVAILABLE MATERIALS, YOU
(`DEVELOPER` or `LICENSEE`) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF DEVELOPER DOES NOT
AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN DO
NOT DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE AND MATERIALS.

The materials available for download to Developers may include
software in both sample source (`Source Code`) and object code
(`Object Code`) versions, documentation (`Documentation`),
certain art work (`Art Assets`) and other materials
(collectively, these materials referred to herein as
`Materials`). Except as expressly indicated herein, all terms
and conditions of this Agreement apply to all of the
Materials.

Except as expressly set forth herein, NVIDIA owns all of the
Materials and makes them available to Developer only under the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.


2.1. License

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
to Developer a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to possess
and to use the Materials. Developer may install and use
multiple copies of the Materials on a shared computer or
concurrently on different computers, and make multiple back-up
copies of the Materials, solely for Licensee`s use within
Licensee`s Enterprise. `Enterprise` shall mean individual use
by Licensee or any legal entity (such as a corporation or
university) and the subsidiaries it owns by more than 50
percent.

The following terms apply to the specified type of Material.


2.1.1. Source Code

Developer shall have the right to modify and create derivative
works with the Source Code. Developer shall own any derivative
works (`Derivatives`) it creates to the Source Code, provided
that Developer uses the Materials in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. Developer may distribute the
Derivatives, provided that all NVIDIA copyright notices and
trademarks are propagated and used properly and the
Derivatives include the following statement: `This software
contains source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation.`


2.1.2. Object Code

Developer agrees not to disassemble, decompile or reverse
engineer the Object Code versions of any of the Materials.
Developer acknowledges that certain of the Materials provided
in Object Code version may contain third party components that
may be subject to restrictions, and expressly agrees not to
attempt to modify or distribute such Materials without first
receiving consent from NVIDIA.


2.1.3. Art Assets

Developer shall have the right to modify and create
Derivatives of the Art Assets, but may not distribute any of
the Art Assets or Derivatives created therefrom without
NVIDIA`s prior written consent.


2.1.4. No Other License

No rights or licenses with respect to any proprietary
information or patent, copyright, trade secret or other
intellectual property right owned or controlled by NVIDIA are
granted by NVIDIA to Developer under this Agreement, expressly
or by implication, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement. Licensee represents and warrants that any and all
third party licensing and/or royalty payment obligations in
connection with Licensee`s use of the H.264 video codecs are
solely the responsibility of Licensee.


2.1.5. Intellectual Property Ownership

All rights, title, interest and copyrights in and to the
Materials (including but not limited to all images,
photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other
information incorporated into the Materials), are owned by
NVIDIA, or its suppliers. The Materials are protected by
copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
Accordingly, Developer is required to treat the Materials like
any other copyrighted material, except as otherwise allowed
pursuant to this Agreement.


2.2. Term of Agreement

This Agreement is effective until (i) automatically terminated
if Developer fails to comply with any of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; or (ii) terminated by NVIDIA.
NVIDIA may terminate this Agreement (and with it, all of
Developer`s right to the Materials) immediately upon written
notice (which may include email) to Developer, with or without
cause. For the sake of clarity, Licensee may continue to use
the Derivatives created pursuant to this Agreement, after the
termination or expiration of this Agreement.


2.3. Defensive Suspension

If Developer commences or participates in any legal proceeding
against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,
suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights
provided under this Agreement during the pendency of such
legal proceedings.


2.4. No Support

NVIDIA has no obligation to support or to continue providing
or updating any of the Materials.


2.5. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE AND ANY OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA TO
DEVELOPER HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED `AS IS.` NVIDIA DISCLAIMS ALL
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.


2.6. Limitation of Liability

NVIDIA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO DEVELOPER, DEVELOPER`S
CUSTOMERS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY CLAIMING THROUGH OR

2. License Grants and Conditions
2.1. Grants
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
a.	under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
b.	under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.
2.2. Effective Date
The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
a.	for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
b.	for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party`s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
c.	under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
2.4. Subsequent Licenses
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
2.5. Representation
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
2.6. Fair Use
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
2.7. Conditions
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
3. Responsibilities
3.1. Distribution of Source Form
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients` rights in the Source Code Form.
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
a.	such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
b.	You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients` rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
3.4. Notices
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
3.5. Application of Additional Terms
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5. Termination
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
6. Disclaimer of Warranty
Covered Software is provided under this License on an `as is` basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
7. Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party`s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
8. Litigation
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party`s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
9. Miscellaneous
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
10. Versions of the License
10.1. New Versions
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
10.2. Effect of New Versions
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
10.3. Modified Versions
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.
You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
Exhibit B - `Incompatible With Secondary Licenses` Notice
This Source Code Form is `Incompatible With Secondary Licenses`, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

3. Time Zone Database
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.
7.  Database Ownership

   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
   contribution or in the TZ Database.

LICENSE RIGHTS 
We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use the programs only for the purpose of developing, testing, prototyping and demonstrating your application, and not for any other purpose. If you use the application you develop under this license for any internal data processing or for any commercial or production purposes, or you want to use the programs for any purpose other than as permitted under this agreement, you must obtain a production release version of the program by contacting us or an Oracle reseller to obtain the appropriate license. You acknowledge that we may not produce a production release version of the program and any development efforts undertaken by you are at your own risk. We may audit your use of the programs. Program documentation, if available, may accessed online at http://otn.oracle.com/docs.

You agree that neither the programs nor any direct product thereof will be exported, directly, or indirectly, in violation of these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.
Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies
THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED `AS IS` WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).
Trial Programs Included With Orders
We may include additional programs with an order which may be used for trial purposes only. You will have 30 days from the delivery date to evaluate these programs. Any use of these programs after the 30 day trial period requires you to obtain the applicable license. Programs licensed for trial purposes are provided `as is` and we do not provide technical support or any warranties for these programs.

Relationship Between the Parties
The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party`s right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party`s products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.
Open Source
`Open Source` software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user`s modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user `combines` with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any `modifications` be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License (`GPL`) in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.
Entire Agreement
You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.

     Works; and

     (d) If the Work includes a `NOTICE` text file as part of its

     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not 
     modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices 
     within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an 
     addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such 
     additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying 
     the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may

responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or 
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your 
exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless 
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent 
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You 
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but 
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility 
of such damages.

the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and 
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other 
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

The following will be added to the notices file for Shrinksafe (and called out 
in the DOU for Dojo):

The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional Shrinksafe build 
tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed with that tool.  Shrinksafe 
contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License 
Version 1.1.  The source code for these modifications has been made available at 
the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.  

The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or higher in order to 
run.  We are relying on the separate DD Checklist already approved for the Rhino 
1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe 
package by default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.

      `Derivative Works` shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      `Contribution` shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, `submitted`

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a `NOTICE` text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an `AS IS` BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

JTOpen Source Code.  The Program includes the following ICU4J Development Group software:  

·	JTOpen 5.1.1 

IBM obtained the right to use the software under the following license from JTOpen:  


IBM Public License Version 1.0 
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM PUBLIC LICENSE (`AGREEMENT`). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT`S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
1. DEFINITIONS 
`Contribution` means: 
a) in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (`IBM`), the Original Program, and 
b) in the case of each Contributor, 
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution `originates` from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor`s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
`Contributor` means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program. 
`Licensed Patents ` mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. 
`Original Program` means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any. 
`Program` means the Original Program and Contributions. 
`Recipient` means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient`s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 
3. REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: 
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
When the Program is made available in source code form: 
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program: 
Copyright © {date here}, International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved. 
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (`Commercial Contributor`) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (`Indemnified Contributor`) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively `Losses`) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor`s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 
5. NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN `AS IS` BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
7. GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient`s patent(s), then such Recipient`s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 
All Recipient`s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance.

Perl 5.  Artistic License:  

·	Perl 5.10.1


				Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

	`Package` refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.

	`Standard Version` refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

	`Copyright Holder` is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.

	`You` is you, if you`re thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.

	`Reasonable copying fee` is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)

	`Freely Available` means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package`s interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called `undump` or `unexec` methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package`s interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED `AS IS` AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following will be added to the notices file for Shrinksafe (and called out in the DOU for Dojo):

The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional Shrinksafe build tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed with that tool.  Shrinksafe contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License Version 1.1.  The source code for these modifications has been made available at the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.

The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or higher in order to run.  We are relying on the separate DD Checklist already approved for the Rhino 1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe package by default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.

    `Contributor` means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

    `Licensed Patents ` mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

    `Program` means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

    `Recipient` means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

    GRANT OF RIGHTS

        Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

        Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

        Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient`s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

        Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

    REQUIREMENTS

    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

        it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

        its license agreement:

        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

    When the Program is made available in source code form:

        it must be made available under this Agreement; and

        a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

    COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (`Commercial Contributor`) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (`Indemnified Contributor`) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively `Losses`) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor`s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

    NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN `AS IS` BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient`s patent(s), then such Recipient`s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    All Recipient`s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient`s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient`s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party`s
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients` rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients` rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
*                                                                      *

*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *

************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party`s ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      `License` shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      `Licensor` shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      `Legal Entity` shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      `control` means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      `You` (or `Your`) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      `Source` form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      `Object` form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      `Work` shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      `Derivative Works` shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      `Contribution` shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, `submitted`
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as `Not a Contribution.`

      `Contributor` shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a `NOTICE` text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an `AS IS` BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Perl 5.  Artistic License:  

Perl 5.10.1

The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under the Artistic License (source code available via the indicated URL):` http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

	`Package` refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.

	`Standard Version` refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

	`Copyright Holder` is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.

	`You` is you, if you`re thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.

	`Reasonable copying fee` is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)

	`Freely Available` means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package`s interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called `undump` or `unexec` methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package`s interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED `AS IS` AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party`s
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients` rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients` rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *

*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *

************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party`s ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

ZLIB CODE.  The Program includes the following zlib software:

zlib 1.2.3

IBM obtained the right to use the software under the following license from zlib:  

zlib 1.2.3 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are also available in other formats from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h (volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@gzip.org). A usage example of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests that the library is working correctly. Another example is given in the file minigzip.c. The compression library itself is composed of all source files except example.c and minigzip.c.

To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at the top of Makefile. In short `make test; make install` should work for most machines. For Unix: `./configure; make test; make install`. For MSDOS, use one of the special makefiles such as Makefile.msc. For VMS, use make_vms.com.

Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@gzip.org>, or to Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version. The zlib home page is http://www.zlib.org or http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ Before reporting a problem, please check this site to verify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest version and check whether the problem still exists or not.

PLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_faq.html before asking for help.

Mark Nelson <markn@ieee.org> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997 issue of  Dr. Dobb`s Journal; a copy of the article is available in http://dogma.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm

The changes made in version 1.2.3 are documented in the file ChangeLog.

Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory `contrib`.

A Java implementation of zlib is available in the Java Development Kit http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/zip/package-summary.html See the zlib home page http://www.zlib.org for details.

A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmqs@cpan.org> is in the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Compress/

A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <amk@amk.ca> is available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-zlib.html

A zlib binding for TCL written by Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com> is availlable at http://www.oche.de/~akupries/soft/trf/trf_zip.html

An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top of zlib by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>, is available in the contrib/minizip directory of zlib.


Notes for some targets:

- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt

- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With   -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32   compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.

- zlib doesn`t work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works   when compiled with cc.

- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is   necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.

- zlib doesn`t work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with   other compilers. Use `make test` to check your compiler.

- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS, BEOS and by some Mac compilers.

- For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/

- When building a shared, i.e. dynamic library on Mac OS X, the library must be installed before testing (do `make install` before `make test`), since the library location is specified in the library.

The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate and zlib specifications were written by L. Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib; they are too numerous to cite here.

MiniZip code

MiniZip 1.1

IBM obtained the right to use the software under the following license from MiniZip:

MiniZip - Copyright (c) 1998-2010 - by Gilles Vollant - version 1.1 64 bits from Mathias Svensson

Introduction
---------------------
MiniZip 1.1 is built from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant ( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )

When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result into risk of breaking compatibility with minizip 1.0.
All possible work was done for compatibility.


Background
---------------------
When adding ZIP64 support Mathias Svensson found that Even Rouault have added ZIP64 
support for unzip.c into minizip for a open source project called gdal ( http://www.gdal.org/ )

That was used as a starting point. And after that ZIP64 support was added to zip.c
some refactoring and code cleanup was also done.


Changed from MiniZip 1.0 to MiniZip 1.1
---------------------------------------
* Added ZIP64 support for unzip ( by Even Rouault )
* Added ZIP64 support for zip ( by Mathias Svensson )
* Reverted some changed that Even Rouault did.
* Bunch of patches received from Gulles Vollant that he received for MiniZip from various users.
* Added unzip patch for BZIP Compression method (patch create by Daniel Borca)
* Added BZIP Compress method for zip
* Did some refactoring and code cleanup

XPDL is the Serialization Format for BPMN. BPMN is a visual process notation standard from the OMG, endorsed by WfMC, and broadly adopted across the industry. But the BPMN standard defines only the look of how the process definition is displayed on the screen. How you store and interchange those process definitions is outside the scope of the standard, and this is where XPDL comes in. XPDL provides a file format that supports every aspect of the BPMN process definition notation including graphical descriptions of the diagram, as well as executable properties used at run time. With XPDL, a product can write out a process definition with full fidelity, and another product can read it in and reproduce the same diagram that was sent.

This formulation of W3C`s notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of `use`.
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation`s assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI`s certification under the Open Source Definition.

8. Claims of Infringement.

If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Subject Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient`s use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients` rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party`s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled `LEGAL` which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor`s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

          (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor`s Modifications are Contributor`s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients` rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients` rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient`s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation (`Netscape`) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases `Mozilla`, `MOZILLAPL`, `MOZPL`, `Netscape`, `MPL`, `NPL` or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN `AS IS` BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as `Participant`)  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant`s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant`s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant`s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY`S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a `commercial item,` as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of `commercial computer software` and `commercial computer software documentation,` as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys` fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as `Multiple-Licensed`.  `Multiple-Licensed` means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

==========================

   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES
============================================

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part  of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:

   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option) with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as
      distributed by us.
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e. the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied, called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.


ANNOTATIONS
===========

  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.

  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as, but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to use and distribute a UPX compressed program.

  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -  any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious by definition.

  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.

  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.

1. NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit License Agreement
----------------------------------------


Important Notice
----------------

READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement (`Agreement`)
for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, including computer software and
associated documentation (`Software`), is the Agreement which
governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its
subsidiaries (`NVIDIA`) downloadable herefrom. By downloading,
installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, You (as
defined below) agree to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement,
do not download the SOFTWARE.


Recitals
--------

Use of NVIDIA`s SOFTWARE requires three elements: the
SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor (`NVIDIA
Hardware`), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected
by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as
well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The
SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your
use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA
Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but
this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such
hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package
with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and
conditions of the SOFTWARE only.


1.1. Definitions


1.1.1. Licensee

`You`, or `Your` shall mean the entity or individual that
downloads and uses the SOFTWARE.


1.1.2. Redistributable Software

`Redistributable Software` shall mean the redistributable
libraries referenced in Attachment A of this Agreement.


1.1.3. Software

`SOFTWARE` shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to
this Agreement.


1.2. Grant of License


1.2.1. Rights and Limitations of Grant

Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this
Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
(except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable
Software in Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3 of this
Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE, with the following
limitations:


1.2.1.1. Redistribution Rights

Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain
files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in
Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a)
the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in
binary form to Licensee`s licensees (`Customers`) only as a
component of Licensee`s own software products (each, a
`Licensee Application`); (b) Licensee shall design the
Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE
files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory
location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c)
Licensee shall obtain each Customer`s written or clickwrap
agreement to the license terms under a written, legally
enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the
SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less
restrictive than this Agreement.


1.2.1.2. Usage Rights

Licensee may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE
on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for
Licensee`s use within Licensee`s Enterprise. `Enterprise`
shall mean individual use by Licensee or any legal entity
(such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it
owns by more than 50 percent.


1.2.1.3. Further Redistribution Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee
may authorize Customers to further redistribute the
Redistributable SOFTWARE that such Customers receive as part
of the Licensee Application, solely in binary form, provided,
however, that Licensee shall require in their standard
software license agreements with Customers that all such
redistributions must be made pursuant to a license agreement
that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights
of NVIDIA whose terms and conditions are at least as
restrictive as those in the applicable Licensee software
license agreement covering the Licensee Application. For
avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall not
affect rights previously granted by Licensee to its Customers
under this Agreement to the extent validly granted to
Customers under Section 1.2.1.1.


1.2.1.4. Linux/FreeBSD Exception

Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 1.2.1.2,
Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3, SOFTWARE designed
exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems,
or other operating systems derived from the source code to
these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed,
provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any
way (except for unzipping of compressed files).


1.2.1.5. Additional Licensing Obligations

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that its use of certain third
party components included with the SOFTWARE may be subject to
additional licensing terms and conditions as set forth or
referenced in Attachment B of this Agreement.


1.2.1.6. Limitations

No Reverse Engineering

Licensee may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble
the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the
source code.

No Separation of Components

The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Except as
authorized in this Agreement, Software component parts of the
Software may not be separated for use on more than one
computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.

No Rental

Licensee may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.


1.3. Term and Termination

This Agreement will continue in effect for two (2) years
(`Initial Term`) after Your initial download and use of the
SOFTWARE, subject to the exclusive right of NVIDIA to
terminate as provided herein. The term of this Agreement will
automatically renew for successive one (1) year renewal terms
after the Initial Term, unless either party provides to the
other party at least three (3) months prior written notice of
termination before the end of the applicable renewal term.

This Agreement will automatically terminate if Licensee fails
to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such
event, Licensee must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and
all of its component parts.


Defensive Suspension

If Licensee commences or participates in any legal proceeding
against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,
suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights
provided under this Agreement during the pendency of such
legal proceedings.


1.4. Copyright

All rights, title, interest and copyrights in and to the
SOFTWARE (including but not limited to all images,
photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other
information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying
printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned
by NVIDIA, or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE is protected by
copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
Accordingly, Licensee is required to treat the SOFTWARE like
any other copyrighted material, except as otherwise allowed
pursuant to this Agreement and that it may make one copy of
the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive purposes.

RESTRICTED RIGHTS NOTICE. Software has been developed entirely
at private expense and is commercial computer software
provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Use, duplication or
disclosure by the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government
subcontractor is subject to the restrictions set forth in the
Agreement under which Software was obtained pursuant to DFARS
227.7202-3(a) or as set forth in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2)
of the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights clause
at FAR 52.227-19, as applicable. Contractor/manufacturer is
NVIDIA, 2701 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95050.


1.5. Applicable Law

This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall
be construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of Delaware.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed. The
courts of Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive
jurisdiction and venue over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement.


1.6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations on Liability


1.6.1. No Warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED `AS IS` AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.


1.6.2. No Liability for Consequential Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL NVIDIA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


1.6.3. No Support

NVIDIA has no obligation to support or to provide any updates
of the Software.


1.7. Miscellaneous


1.7.1. Feedback

Notwithstanding any Non-Disclosure Agreement executed by and
between the parties, the parties agree that in the event
Licensee or NVIDIA provides Feedback (as defined below) to the
other party on how to design, implement, or improve the
SOFTWARE or Licensee`s product(s) for use with the SOFTWARE,
the following terms and conditions apply the Feedback:


1.7.1.1. Exchange of Feedback

Both parties agree that neither party has an obligation to
give the other party any suggestions, comments or other
feedback, whether verbally or in written or source code form,
relating to (i) the SOFTWARE; (ii) Licensee`s products; (iii)
Licensee`s use of the SOFTWARE; or (iv)
optimization/interoperability of Licensee`s product with the
SOFTWARE (collectively defined as `Feedback`). In the event
either party provides Feedback to the other party, the party
receiving the Feedback may use any Feedback that the other
party voluntarily provides to improve the (i) SOFTWARE or
other related NVIDIA technologies, respectively for the
benefit of NVIDIA; or (ii) Licensee`s product or other related
Licensee technologies, respectively for the benefit of
Licensee. Accordingly, if either party provides Feedback to
the other party, both parties agree that the other party and
its respective licensees may freely use, reproduce, license,
distribute, and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in the
(i) SOFTWARE or other related technologies; or (ii) Licensee`s
products or other related technologies, respectively, without
the payment of any royalties or fees.


1.7.1.2. Residual Rights

Licensee agrees that NVIDIA shall be free to use any general
knowledge, skills and experience, (including, but not limited
to, ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques) (`Residuals`),
contained in the (i) Feedback provided by Licensee to NVIDIA;
(ii) Licensee`s products shared or disclosed to NVIDIA in
connection with the Feedback; or (c) Licensee`s confidential
information voluntarily provided to NVIDIA in connection with
the Feedback, which are retained in the memories of NVIDIA`s
employees, agents, or contractors who have had access to such
Residuals. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, NVIDIA`s employees, agents, or contractors shall
not be prevented from using Residuals as part of such
employee`s, agent`s or contractor`s general knowledge, skills,
experience, talent, and/or expertise. NVIDIA shall not have
any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such
employees, agents or contractors or to pay royalties for any
work resulting from the use of Residuals.


1.7.1.3. Disclaimer of Warranty

FEEDBACK FROM EITHER PARTY IS PROVIDED FOR THE OTHER PARTY`S
USE `AS IS` AND BOTH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. BOTH PARTIES DO NOT
REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE FEEDBACK WILL MEET THE OTHER
PARTY`S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OR IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE FEEDBACK WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.


1.7.1.4. No Liability for Consequential Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE FEEDBACK, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


1.7.2. Freedom of Action

Licensee agrees that this Agreement is nonexclusive and NVIDIA
may currently or in the future be developing software, other
technology or confidential information internally, or
receiving confidential information from other parties that
maybe similar to the Feedback and Licensee`s confidential
information (as provided in Section 1.7.1.2 above), which may
be provided to NVIDIA in connection with Feedback by Licensee.
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that nothing in this Agreement
will be construed as a representation or inference that NVIDIA
will not develop, design, manufacture, acquire, market
products, or have products developed, designed, manufactured,
acquired, or marketed for NVIDIA, that compete with the
Licensee`s products or confidential information.


1.7.3. No Implied Licenses

Under no circumstances should anything in this Agreement be
construed as NVIDIA granting by implication, estoppel or
otherwise, (i) a license to any NVIDIA product or technology
other than the SOFTWARE; or (ii) any additional license rights
for the SOFTWARE other than the licenses expressly granted in
this Agreement.


1.7.4. 

If any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, or
cannot be fully enforced under, the law, such provision will
be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be
consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This
Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement
between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and
agreements relating to such subject matter, whether oral or
written. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed
by an authorized officer of NVIDIA. Licensee agrees that it
will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
United States Bureau of Industry and Security or any export
laws, restrictions or regulations.


1.7.5. 

The parties agree that the following sections of the Agreement
will survive the termination of the License: Section 1.2.1.4,
Section 1.4, Section 1.5, Section 1.6, and Section 1.7.


1.8. Attachment A


Redistributable Software

    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the `BSD` licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the `doc` 
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also 
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are 
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

8. APPLICABLE LAW.

a. United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States,
Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies
to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.  The
laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims
under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

b. Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other
country, the laws of that country apply.

9. LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have
other rights under the laws of your country.  You may also have rights with
respect to the party from whom you acquired the software.  This agreement does
not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your
country do not permit it to do so.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.   THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED `AS-IS.`  YOU BEAR THE
RISK OF USING IT.  MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
CONDITIONS.  YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS
WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL
LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00.  YOU CANNOT
RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to

* anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
  party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
* claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition,
  strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
  applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental, consequential or other damages.

- Apache Tuscany(SDO) Modified Classes
IBM made certain modifications to the Apache Tuscany Code for the SDO component, which modifications are referred to as the `Apache Tuscany Classes (SDO)`. The Apache Tuscany Classes (SDO) were not contributed back to the Apache Software Foundation because they are unique to this Program and its SDO component. The list of modified Apache Tuscany Classes and source code for the Apache Tuscany Classes can be obtained from IBM by visiting http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wps/support and selecting `Technotes`. Under `Product category`, select `WPS Business Object Framework` as the search filter to locate technotes that provide information about this modified source code.

The following will be added to the notices file for Shrinksafe (and called out in the DOU for Dojo):

The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional Shrinksafe build tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed
with that tool. Shrinksafe contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License Version 1.1. The
source code for these modifications has been made available at the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.

The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or higher in order to run. We are relying on the separate DD Checklist
already approved for the Rhino 1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe package by default
is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.

in the DOU for Dojo):

The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional Shrinksafe build
tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed with that tool. Shrinksafe
contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License
Version 1.1. The source code for these modifications has been made available at
the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.

The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or higher in order to
run. We are relying on the separate DD Checklist already approved for the Rhino
1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe

However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
limit or alter the recipient`s rights in the Source Code form from
the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.

Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN `AS IS` BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
assert such claim is referred to as `Participant`) alleging that the
Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
a written agreement with Participant.

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY`S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a `commercial item,` as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of `commercial computer
software` (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and `commercial computer software documentation`
as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction`s conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys` fees and expenses.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

GNU Lesser General Public License
Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author`s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
We call this license the `Lesser` General Public License because it does Less to protect the user`s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users` freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a `work based on the library` and a `work that uses the library`. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called `this License`). Each licensee is addressed as `you`.
A `library` means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The `Library`, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A `work based on the Library` means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term `modification`.)
`Source code` for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library`s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a `work that uses the Library`. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a `work that uses the Library` with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a `work that uses the library`. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a `work that uses the Library` uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a `work that uses the Library` with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer`s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable `work that uses the Library`, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user`s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the `work that uses the Library` must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients` exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and `any later version`, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY `AS IS` WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the `copyright` line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the library`s name and an idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a `copyright disclaimer` for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob` (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
